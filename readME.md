# Notes App

## Description
  This is my first time building a single page dynamic web app. I used js to control the flow of the webpage dynamically and an api to interact with the webpage. 

## Set up + Install

```linux
npm i 
npm run build 

<!-- then double click on the index.html to open in a browser -->

<!-- or select view index.html in finder and open from there to take you 
to the browser  -->
```

## Setup + Run tests

```linux
npm i jest 
jest
```

## app running in browser
